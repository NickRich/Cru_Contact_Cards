# Cru_Contact_Cards
This is an attempt at digitizing the contact cards used by Purdue Cru in order to make everything more accessible and easier to sort.

Goal:
Info from cards gets stored in a database or cloud of somekind.
People can get info regarding to their target areas right on their phone so they don't have to hunt down physical cards
when going sharing.
